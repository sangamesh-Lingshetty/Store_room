## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution Task: Fix the Reminder UI Issue

### Bug Description:
Currently, in the application, when you set a reminder for a task, it gets saved successfully in the backend. However, in the To-Do List UI, the reminder **does not display correctly**. Instead, it always shows a default message like "No reminder set," even when a reminder has been set.

### Expected Behavior:
- **Current Behavior**: When a reminder is set, the task should show the reminder time and an appropriate reminder icon in the UI.
- **Desired Fix**: The reminder UI should correctly display the time and icon when a reminder is set, and show a "No reminder set" message when no reminder is assigned.
